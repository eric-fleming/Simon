# Simon

This program is the beginning skeleton to recreate the game Simon. The goal is to watch the colors that light up and repeat what you see. There should be more than one level. Currently there is no way to check if what you click is correct. A second javascript file would be appropriate to handle that behavior.

###Goals of this project
- To witness and test how HTML,CSS,and JS can interact with one another.
- To see how a program is made out of variables, values, objects, functions, and instructions.
- To think through the process of designing a program and breaking it into subgoals, smaller pieces of code to be implemented and reused.
